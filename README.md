## My Process

I developed a news homepage featuring a clean and dynamic design that adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes. The page includes interactive elements like a responsive navigation menu, lazy-loaded images, and smooth scrolling effects.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilized modern HTML elements for structuring the news homepage, improving readability and accessibility.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Employed CSS variables for consistent styling and easy theming.
- **Flexbox & Grid:** Applied for layout and alignment, ensuring a responsive design across different devices.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilized `clamp()` for fluid typography and media queries to adapt the layout to various screen sizes.
- **JavaScript:** Managed user interactions and dynamic updates, including handling scrolling effects, lazy loading images, and responsive menu behavior.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my skills in:

- **CSS Transitions:** Implementing smooth animations for interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design:** Applying CSS techniques for adaptable layouts and fluid typography.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Managing user interactions, including scrolling and lazy loading of images.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implementing lazy loading to improve page load times and performance.

### Continued Development

Future improvements will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript Features:** Adding more interactive elements and improving data handling techniques.
- **CSS Animations:** Experimenting with advanced CSS animations for a more engaging user experience.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Ensuring the component is fully accessible to users with diverse needs and preferences.
